# CDF Project Onboarding

This is a high level overview of onboarding for new CDF projects that have been accepted into the foundation by the technical oversight committee.
The listed actions should happen shortly after the project is accepted,
with a longer but reasonable grace period for legal actions like trademark and patent transfer.

## Community

* Code of Conduct - The project should introduce an inclusive code of conduct if it does not already exist.
   It is recommended to adopt [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and document the Continuous Delivery Foundation as the escalation level next to the project
* Add community meetings to the CDF Public calendar
* Recommended: Delegate a representative to the Continuous Delivery Foundation that would participate in the CDF TOC mailing list and other foundation events

## Technical & Infrastructure

   * Domain Transfer - project-related domains should be transferred to the Linus Foundation via an issue created here https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/theme/portal/2/group/19
   * Github Repos - project-related repositories must be located in a neutral LF Github organization. The current GitHub organization owner must invite the user "thelinuxfoundation" (no quotes) as an owner.  GitHubâ€™s documentation for how to do that is here: https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/transferring-organization-ownership 
   * Zoom account - projects may request a zoom sub-account for scheduling community meetings. Please submit a ticket to CDF Helpdesk, identifying key community members who should have access. 
   * Other communication channels - Ideally we expect all communication channels (e.g. Slack, Mailing Lists, etc.) to be transferred to the CDF/Linux Foundation.
     Please coordinate the list with the stakeholders from the foundation.
 
## Legal

  * Any registered marks for the project must be transferred to the Linux Foundation. 
  * Recommended: the project should establish the open source license scanning for the project.
    * NOTE: LFX Security was not onboarding new projects as of May 2022. Alternative solutions may be used  

## Outreach & Marketing 

  * A press release announcing the new project will be put out by CDF. Please identify key messaging and community members to provide quotes and email pr@cd.foundation
  * Podcast - projects are welcome to do a kickoff episode on The Pipeline Podcast, more detail here: https://cd.foundation/podcast/
  * CDF Landscape - add the project to the [CDF Landscape](https://github.com/cdfoundation/cdf-landscape) for better visibility
